## Welcome to DeepWild! ##

We have multiple versions of DeepWild ready to be shared, depending on your needs. 

Deepwild 1.0:
This is the version of DeepWild we used for the DeepWild paper. It contains 2150 manually marked training frames from 110 diffeeent videos. The model is trained on 2
species (chimpanzee and bonobo) from 5 different populations. This model is entirely open source and readily downloadable on GitHub. You can add your own training 
data (either new key features or more training frames). 

Deepwild 1.1: 
This is our most recent version of DeepWild. It contains 4025 manually marked training frames from 187 different videos. This model is trained on 2 species (chimpanzee
and bonobo) from 6 different populations. The pre-trained model is open source and ready to download on GitHub. However, some of the videos and training frames are
not due to sharing restrictions on some of the video data. This means the pre-trained model can be downloaded and you can enter your own novel data to track apes but
you cannot add your own training data (either new key features or more training frames). If you would like to do so, please contact us via email (cw266@st-andrews.ac.uk)
and we can discuss sharing this data with you.
