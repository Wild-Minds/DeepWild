# DeepWild
DeepWild contains all our code, protocols, and data on our DeepLabCut trained full body wild ape models

## What is DeepWild?
DeepWild is a machine learning model trained to track the movement of great apes in video data, created using DeepLabCut
The model tracks 18 key points along an apes body. It can track multiple individuals and has been trained to work with wild data.

## How can I use DeepWild? 
You can download the most recent version of the model here. You can use the model 'off the shelf'- input your video data into the model and it will track your apes. Or, you can use this model as a base to change the model to suit your needs. You may want to add new keypoints or add new videos to the training dataset.
