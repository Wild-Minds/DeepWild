This is 'Model 1' in the DeepWild paper.
This model has not changed from the original submission, but because 'Model 2' was re-trained for the paper to contain more frames, this model was also re-trained to allow fair comparison as DeepLabCut had been updated.
It contains frames marked by Charlotte.
